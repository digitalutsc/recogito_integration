To load on a page, requires an openseadragon viewer to be present. Additionally, requires a drupalSettings variable 'islandora_open_seadragon_viewer' set to the viewer used for openseadragon.

For example:
`var viewer = new OpenSeadragon.Viewer(options);`
`drupalSettings.islandora_open_seadragon_viewer = viewer`
